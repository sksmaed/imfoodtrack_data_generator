## Task 1: Clone, Pull and Push

### Task 1-1

**Clone** the repository to your laptop and successfully run ``foodtracker_train_data_generator.py``.

Don't forget to **add ``.gitignore``** to your own ``.env`` file.

### Task 1-2

Make some modifications and **commit** your change, then **push** it to the remote repository.

## Task 2: Branch

### Task 2-2

Check the status of the local repository and commit the stashed changes.

### Task 2-3

**Push the new branch** to the remote repository and create a **pull request**. Note that you should choose ``master`` to be the compared branch.
